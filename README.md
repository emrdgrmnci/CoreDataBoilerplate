### Core Data Boilerplate Code Block

- Just `copy-paste` to your `.swift` file!!!

- You created your iOS project and forgot to select `Use Core Data` option when creating your project.

- So you can use my one page open source project to do not need to `Create New Project` including `Use Core Data` option selected after already you created a project.

- Do not forget to add `import CoreData` line to top of your `.swift` file.
